# This repository stores scripts for Luyties et al., 2024 #

There are three main folders - HCT116_ChIPseq, HCT116_PROseq, and HEK293_nascent. These correspond to the cell type/protocols of the experiments.

Each of these directories contains scripts for metagene creation, and the HCT116 directories also have script for calculating pause ratios and determining elongation ratio as described in the paper.
